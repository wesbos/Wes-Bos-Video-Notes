# CSS Grid Image Gallery

When one of the grid-column span values is larger than the grid-row span value, the image height in chrome is greater than 100%. This causes the "View" button to be pushed further down, out of vertical center. It is not an issue in firefox or chrome. Just be aware. As of now, there is no known fix.
