# Speech Synthesis

# For this to work in Firefox (and all other browsers) the SpeechSynthesis.addEventListener should be replaced with             
#            populateVoices();
#            if (speechSynthesis.onvoiceschanged !== undefined) {
#                speechSynthesis.onvoiceschanged = populateVoices;
#            }
